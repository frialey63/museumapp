The museum was opened in 1986 by a small group of enthusiasts, originally under the guise of the RAF Manstonn History Club.  It has grown steadily with input from many dedicated volunteers to become the significant historic aviation attraction, that you will experience today.  The buildings in which you stand were once aircraft maintenance hangars of the Mechanical Transport Squadron, and date back to the very origins of the airfield.  The museum has occupied these buildings since the mid-1990s, and today boasts an extensive collection of exhibits illustrating the complete history of Manstonn, including 23 airframes.
