## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

# Access by Android in Development Mode

[Accessing the Android phone's camera in development mode via HTTP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52759992/how-to-access-camera-and-microphone-in-chrome-without-https)

> This worked for me. Although it's for Testing purpose only.
>
> To ignore Chromeâ€™s secure origin policy, follow these steps. Navigate to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` in Chrome.
>
> Find and enable the Insecure origins treated as secure section (see below). Add any addresses you want to ignore the secure origin policy for. Remember to include the port number too (if required). Save and restart Chrome.
>
> Remember this is for dev purposes only. The live working app will need to be hosted on https for users to be able to use their microphone or camera.

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/museumapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

# Deploying to Azure

    az login
    az acr login -n rafmanstoncontainerregistry
    mvn -Pproduction compile jib:build
